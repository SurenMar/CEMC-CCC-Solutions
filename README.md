# CEMC-CCC-Solutions
This repository contains solutions and explanations to the CEMC CCC contests written in Python

## Overview
- The goal of this repository is to provide a technical understanding to the approach of a problem, which is why the solutions are in Python.
- Starting with the 2025 **Junior** contest, I will be completing each years contest, then moving on to **Senior**.
- If you find a bug in my solution, or simply have a better solution, please feel free to commit.
- You can find the full set of contests from the past 10 years at the [CEMC website](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/resources/past-contests).

*Please note these problems were **not** solved in a competitive environment.*
